# cellfinder

cellfinder is software for automated 3D cell detection in very large 3D images (e.g., serial two-photon or lightsheet 
volumes of whole mouse brains).

cellfinder exists as three separate software packages.

## cellfinder-core
`cellfinder-core` is a Python package implementing the core algorithm for efficient cell detection in large images.

The package exists on its own to allow developers to implement the algorithm in their own software. For now, the only 
API documentation is in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder-core/blob/main/README.md), please 
see the documentation [here](user-guide/parameters) for an explanation of the parameters. Alternatively, please 
[get in touch](/contact).

## cellfinder napari plugin

This is a thin wrapper around the `cellfinder-core` package and aims to:

* Provide the cell detection algorithm in a user-friendly form
* Allow the cell detection algorithm to be chained together with other tools in the Napari ecosystem
* Allow easier parameter optimisation for users of the other cellfinder tools.

## cellfinder command-line tool
A command-line tool (confusingly just called `cellfinder`) exists to combine the `cellfinder-core` cell detection 
algorithm and [brainreg](/documentation/brainreg/index). `cellfinder` can:

* Detect labelled cells in 3D in whole-brain images (many hundreds of GB)
* Register the image to an atlas (such as the [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=602630314)\)
* Segment the brain based on the reference atlas
* Calculate the volume of each brain area, and the number of labelled cells within it
* Transform everything into standard space for analysis and visualisation
